EXPLANATION OF OYSTERCATCHER GPS DATA  -  Emiel van Loon

======= INTRODUCTION =======

This archive contains several comma-delimited ascii files
with data on the movement of three Oystercatchers. 
It has been previously described and used in the article
'From sensor data to animal behaviour: an oystercatcher 
example.' by Shamoun-Baranes et al. (2012) (PLoS One,7(5), 
e37997. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037997). 
This paper will be called S2B in the remainder of this 
text.


======= ORIGINS OF THE DATA ======= 

The data result from a field study during May - July 2009. 
Three birds were equipped with the University of Amsterdam 
Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS).
This system registered location and acceleration. From
June 30 till July 31 2009 a GPS fix was taken every 10 
minutes. Each GPS fix was followed by an acceleration 
measurement during 3 seconds at 20 Hz.
From 30 June through 14 July 2009, the behaviour of each 
bird was also observed and registered daily for 30 minutes 
with a telescope. During these visual observations, the 
tracking device was set to take a GPS fix every 10 seconds 
followed by 3 seconds of acceleration measurements.
A more complete and detailed description of the field work  
can be found in the methods section of S2B. 

The data resulting from this field work has been stored in 
different tables:
 gps           - location and instantaneous speed, 
                 measured by GPS sensor 
 accelerometer - acceleration at each GPS fix during 3 sec. 
                 at 20 Hz in 3D, by accelerometer sensor 
 behaviour     - observed behaviour (16 classes) and
                 aggregations thereof (8 and 3 classes),
                 corresponding to Table 2 in S2B.

More details of these tables are given in the next section
(DETALS OF DATA TABLES).
 
To build classification models on the basis of sensor data 
and observed behaviour, the raw accelerometer data were not 
used directly, but aggregate variables were calculated (so
called predictor variables, see Table 3 in S2B). The 
predictor variables were stored in a separate table 
(predictors). For each record in the behaviour table there 
is a corresponding record in the predictors table. But not
the other way around: the predictors table contains many 
records where only sensor data was recorded while the 
behaviour was not observed visually.  

After deriving two suitable classification models (SA3 and 
SA8), these were applied on all cases where sensor data
were available (all records in the predictors table), and 
the resulting classifications were stored in a separate 
table(model_output).      

On the basis of this model output, a time budget 
calculation was made. The time spent on different 
behaviours was established while distinguishing day and 
night as well as three spatial zones (territory, saltmarsh 
and mudflats). The information required for the time budget 
calculation (the time period and zone for each GPS fix), 
was stored in a separate table (habitat).

behaviour, predictors, model_output and habitat.
